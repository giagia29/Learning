							To paint a better view of what is IoT, it helps to imagine that it is an ecosystem of devices, machines, appliances or any other things that can be connected to the internet through the wired or wireless network. The established network between devices allows data integration and exchange between the computer system and physical devices. This new chapter of technological advances is meant to be the step towards even better efficiency and productivity of daily people’s life.
