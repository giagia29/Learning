What is CSS?
- stands for Cascading Stylesheets
- NOT a programming language
- Stylesheet/Styling language
- Used for website layout and design
3 methods for adding CSS
- Inline CSS: Directly in the html element (NO! Do not recommend to use)

- Internal CSS: Using <style> tags within a single document

- External CSS: Linking an external .css file
To use external CSS:
- Create a new file, save as .CSS type
- In the main .HTML file, under tag <title>, type in "link" and press Tab => it will show up <link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="">
=> type in the .CSS file name in href then click save.

Margin & Padding Shorthand
p{
    margin-top: 5px;
    margin-bottom: 5px;
    margin-right: 10px;
}

In order to use "position: absolute" => has to set up "position: relative" first (within that area working on).
