			I believe there are no boundaries in knowledge pursuit and every student has their freedom of choice to follow their academic desire.<strong> I am not an exception among thousands of young scholars who are studying diligently and I have always wanted to be a part of something bigger.</strong> Currently, I am a freshman at the University of Texas at Arlington, and it is such an honor to join with the elite students at UTA Honors College. <em>If my application is admitted by the Admission Committee, I will prove that I am an eligible person who possesses outstanding knowledge in problem-solving and my ability will elevate UTA Honors College academic level and reputation.</em> In return, UTA Honors College would certainly support me in academic growth, offer me more chances to improve my studying and working paths such as a detailed career developing plan, financial aid, and job application.

			<a href="http://google.com" target="_blank">Last but not least, I cannot fulfill my goal without UTA Honors College assistance.
			</a> The department will surely support me in academic growth by providing various opportunities to study, push me to open more to people and make more connections among the community. The experience that I gain in Honors College will shine in my cover letter or resume in the future. Hopefully, Honors College will help me to outperform other applicants and I will get recruited by famous corporations.
