	(Dnumber		INT					NOT NULL,
	 Dlocation 		VARCHAR(15)			NOT NULL,
	 PRIMARY KEY (Dnumber, Dlocation),
	 FOREIGN KEY (Dnumber) REFERENCES DEPARTMENT (Dnumber) );

.read HRTables.sql

INSERT INTO 'table_name'('attribute1', 'attribute2') VALUES ('value1', 'value2');

=> INSERT INTO regions(region_id, region_name) VALUES (1, 'Europe');

.header on => gives the name of the attribute (name of column)
.mode column
